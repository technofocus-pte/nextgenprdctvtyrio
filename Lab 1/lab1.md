# **Build an Enterprise Marketing Operations Agent with Microsoft 365 Copilot**

Estimated duration: 40 minutes

# **Scenario**

Zava Retail is a growing SMB omnichannel retailer with 12 physical
stores and a successful online business. Its marketing team runs
frequent, multi-channel campaigns --- seasonal sales, product launches,
loyalty promotions --- but has no consistent, repeatable way to plan
them.

Every campaign brief looks different depending on who wrote it. Creative
assets for email, social, SMS, and in-store signage are produced
separately by different people, often inconsistent in tone and
messaging. Executives receive campaign summaries in varying formats,
which slows approvals. And when a campaign needs to be adapted --- for
loyalty members, for a premium audience, or for different store regions
--- the team frequently starts over instead of building the original
plan.

As Marketing Operations Lead, Priya Nair is responsible for how
campaigns move from idea to execution to executive sign-off. With a
Summer Clearance campaign due for leadership approval by the end of the
week, Priya needs a faster, more consistent way to plan the campaign,
produce channel-ready assets, adapt it for different audiences and
regions, and package it for executive review.

To solve this, Zava Retail has adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. Priya
will build a reusable custom agent --- the Zava Retail Marketing
Operations Advisor --- that plans campaigns to a consistent enterprise
structure, generates creative assets, adapts content for different
audiences and channels, and prepares executive-ready summaries.

# **Objectives**

During this lab, you will use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to:

- Create a custom Copilot agent --- build a dedicated marketing
  operations assistant from scratch with a defined name and purpose.

- Configure enterprise-grade instructions --- enforce a consistent,
  complete campaign structure and enable image generation and web
  search.

- Generate a structured campaign brief and creative assets --- produce a
  complete campaign plan and a promotional banner from a single prompt.

- Adapt campaigns for different audiences, channels, and regions ---
  refine content while preserving the original objective and KPIs.

- Prepare and validate an executive approval package --- produce
  leadership-ready materials and confirm the agent works reliably for
  the whole team.

# **Key Personas**

- **Priya Nair -- Marketing Operations Lead (Learner):** Owns campaign
  planning and execution at Zava Retail and builds the Copilot agent to
  standardize campaign briefs, creative assets, and executive reporting.

- **David Kim -- VP of Marketing:** Executive sponsor for the Summer
  Clearance campaign who requires every campaign brief to include an
  executive summary, KPIs, and clearly flagged risks and assumptions
  before he approves it.

- **Sam Osei -- Creative Director:** Leads the creative team and needs
  channel-ready first-draft copy and imagery across email, social, SMS,
  and in-store signage, so designers and copywriters aren\'t starting
  from a blank page.

- **Regional Store Directors -- North, South, Urban, Rural:** Require
  the same campaign to be adapted to local context --- timing, product
  emphasis, and preferred channels --- without changing the underlying
  campaign objective.

# **Exercise 1: Create and Configure the Marketing Operations Agent**

In this exercise, you will sign in to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat as
Priya Nair and create a new custom agent from scratch. This exercise

# **Exercise 2: Build the Summer Clearance Campaign Brief**

David Kim has asked Priya for a complete campaign plan for the Summer
Clearance event before he\'ll consider it for approval. In this
exercise, you will test whether a single prompt produces a complete,
structured campaign brief.

## **Task 1 -- Generate the Campaign Brief**

1.  Open a chat with the Zava Retail Marketing Operations Advisor.\
    ![](media/media/imagea.png){width="6.25in" height="2.375in"}

2.  Paste the following prompt, then select **Send**:

Create a complete Summer Clearance campaign (up to 50% off apparel)\
with the full 9-section structure, and generate (render, don\'t just\
describe) a hero banner image for the Creative Assets section that\
reflects the offer and Zava Retail\'s brand voice.\
![](media/media/imageb.png){width="6.5in" height="3.0625in"}

3.  Confirm the Creative Assets section includes a promotional banner
    concept, and that an image has been generated if Image Generation is
    enabled.\
    ![](media/media/imagec.png){width="6.25in"
    height="4.177083333333333in"}

**Note:** Generated outputs are non-deterministic and may vary across
users, sessions, and environments.

4.  Review the response and confirm it includes all nine required
    sections: Campaign Objective, Target Audience, Key Messaging,
    Channels, Timeline, KPIs, Risks and Assumptions, Executive Summary,
    and Creative Assets.

**Note:** Generated outputs are non-deterministic and may vary across
users, sessions, and environments.

# **Exercise 3: Generate Multi-channel Campaign Assets**

Sam Osei\'s creative team needs a running start across every channel,
not just the core brief. In this exercise, you will ask the agent to
translate the Summer Clearance campaign into channel-ready assets for
seven distinct formats in a single request.

## **Task 1 -- Generate Channel Assets**

1.  In the same conversation as Exercise 2 (to preserve campaign
    context), paste the following prompt, then select Send:

+++Generate assets for this campaign across the following channels:
Email,\
Teams announcement, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, SMS, and in-store\
digital signage. For each channel, provide the copy, tone adjustments,\
and any format-specific notes (e.g., character limits, image aspect\
ratio).+++\
![](media/media/imaged.png){width="6.5in" height="4.333333333333333in"}

2.  Review each of the seven channel outputs and confirm they are
    adapted to the channel.

![](media/media/imagee.png){width="5.979166666666667in" height="6.5in"}

## **Task 2 -- Generate a Promotional Image**

1.  Paste the following prompt, then select Send:

Generate a promotional image for the Instagram post that matches the\
Summer Clearance campaign\'s messaging and Zava Retail\'s brand voice.

2.  Confirm that an image is generated and visually consistent with the
    campaign messaging.

# **Exercise 4: Refine the Campaign for Loyalty Members**

David Kim has a follow-up request: loyalty program members shouldn\'t
receive the same "everything must go" clearance messaging as everyone
else --- they should feel like they\'re getting early, exclusive access.
In this exercise, you will refine the existing campaign without starting
over.

## **Task 1 -- Refine for Audience and Brand Tone**

1.  In the same conversation, paste the following prompt, then select
    Send:\
    \
    +++Refine this campaign for loyalty program members, with a more
    premium\
    brand feel. Preserve the original campaign objective and KPIs, but\
    adjust messaging, tone, and offer framing accordingly.+++\
    ![](media/media/imagef.png){width="6.25in"
    height="4.239583333333333in"}

2.  Review the response and confirm it explicitly states:

    a.  What changed (e.g., messaging shifted from "clearance" to
        "exclusive loyalty access")\
        ![](media/media/image10.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.4583333333333335in"}

    b.  What was preserved (objective, KPIs, timeline)\
        ![](media/media/image11.png){width="5.75in" height="3.84375in"}

Note: Confirm the tone reads as more premium --- word choice, pacing,
and framing should feel distinct from the original mass-market version.

# **Exercise 5: Adapt the Campaign for Regional Stores**

Zava Retail\'s regional store directors have flagged that a single
national message doesn\'t land the same way in every market. In this
exercise, you will generate four regional versions of the same campaign.

## **Task 1 -- Generate Regional Variants**

1.  In the same conversation, paste the following prompt, then select
    Send:\
    +++Create four regional versions of this campaign for: North stores,
    South\
    stores, Urban stores, and Rural stores. Highlight any differences
    in\
    messaging, product mix emphasis, or channel priority for each
    version,\
    while keeping the core campaign objective identical.+++\
    ![](media/media/image12.png){width="6.25in"
    height="4.177083333333333in"}

2.  Review each of the four versions and confirm:

    a.  Each has a distinct regional angle (e.g., Urban emphasizes foot
        traffic and digital signage; Rural emphasizes SMS and local
        relevance)\
        ![](media/media/image13.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.1354166666666665in"}

    b.  All four versions stay consistent with the original campaign
        objective and KPIs\
        ![](media/media/image14.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.4270833333333335in"}

# **Exercise 6: Prepare the Executive Approval Package**

David Kim has one rule for Friday\'s leadership review: every campaign
pitch must be scannable in under two minutes. In this exercise, you will
generate a complete executive approval package from the campaign you\'ve
built.

## **Task 1 -- Generate the Executive Approval Package**

3.  In the same conversation, paste the following prompt, then select
    Send:\
    +++Prepare an executive approval package for this campaign,
    including:\
    - Executive summary\
    - Expected business impact\
    - Campaign risks\
    - Assumptions\
    - Success metrics\
    - Approval checklist+++\
    ![](media/media/image15.png){width="6.25in"
    height="4.208333333333333in"}

<!-- -->

4.  Review the response, it must cover the following points:

    a.  Executive Summary: 3--5 sentence overview for a VP-level
        decision-maker\
        ![](media/media/image16.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.4583333333333335in"}

    b.  Expected Business Impact: quantified or directional impact
        (revenue, traffic, engagement)\
        ![](media/media/image17.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.1770833333333335in"}

    c.  Campaign Risks: realistic risks (e.g., inventory shortfall,
        message fatigue, timing conflicts)\
        ![](media/media/image18.png){width="5.75in" height="3.84375in"}

    d.  Assumptions: explicitly flagged placeholders (budget, dates,
        inventory levels)\
        ![](media/media/image19.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.8645833333333335in"}

    e.  Success Metrics: tied back to the KPIs from Exercise 3\
        ![](media/media/image1a.png){width="5.75in" height="3.8125in"}

    f.  Approval Checklist: actionable items (e.g., Legal review, Brand
        review, Budget sign-off, Channel scheduling confirmed)\
        ![](media/media/image1b.png){width="5.75in"
        height="3.8333333333333335in"}

# **Summary**
